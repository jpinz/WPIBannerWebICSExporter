# WPIBannerWebICSExporter
Chrome extension to export an ICS from your WPI Bannerweb schedule

Not yet uploaded to the Chrome Dev store, I'll do it soon

Thanks to Evin Ugur https://github.com/evinugur for the original code. I just updated it to work in 2016.

## Installation
- Download the folder and extract to a location.
- Go into chrome://extensions and enable Developer Mode
- Click Load Unpacked Extension and chose the folder you extracted to

## Usage
1. Bannerweb
2. Registration
3. Student Schedule by Day and Time
4. Navigate to the most recent week with a full week schedule
5. Click Download
6. Import ICS into calendar app of choice, but idk what works. YMMV

## Bugs
- Doesn't account for Vacation days, and is currently hardcoded to end on October 13th, 2016. When A Term ends.
- Currently doesn't work when importing directly into Google Calendar, I had to first import it into outlook then export, then import into Google Calendar. Then it worked.
