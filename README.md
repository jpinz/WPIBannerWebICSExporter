# WPIBannerWebICSExporter
Chrome extension to export an ICS from your WPI Bannerweb schedule

Not yet uploaded to the Chrome Dev store, I'll do it soon

## Installation
- Download the folder and extract to a location.
- Go into chrome://extensions and enable Developer Mode
- Click Load Unpacked Extension and chose the folder you extracted to

## Usage
1. Bannerweb
2. Registration
3. Concise Student Schedule
4. Select Term
5. Click Download
6. Import ICS into calendar app of choice, but idk what works. YMMV

## Todo
- Make it so that classes before the first day of the first term dont get added
- Fix importing into Google Calendar
- Add vacation days/days where classes dont meet
- Comment out console logging
- Add Comments
- Schedule meeting time second row isn't counted for labs/lectures

## Bugs
- Currently doesn't work when importing directly into Google Calendar, I had to first import it into outlook then export, then import into Google Calendar. Then it worked.
